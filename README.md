# Stock Price Analysis ðŸ“ˆ
This project is a comprehensive analysis of stock price data using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis includes exploring stock price changes over time, computing moving averages, and understanding correlations among multiple variables. The main focus is on Apple stock and various other companies to gain insights into market trends and stock behavior.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to perform a detailed analysis of stock price data using several financial and statistical techniques. The analysis covers a variety of methods to understand stock performance and trends, providing useful insights into stock market behavior.

# Key Analysis Performed:
  # Analyzing Change in Stock Price Over Time:

Visualized and studied the historical price movement of stocks.
Investigated stock trends over various time periods to understand long-term and short-term fluctuations.

# Analyzing Moving Averages:

Calculated moving averages (SMA, EMA) for multiple stocks to smooth out price data.
Used moving averages to identify potential buy/sell signals.

# Observing Close Price Changes in Apple Stock:

Focused analysis on Apple stock to observe daily and long-term close price changes.
Explored significant movements in close prices and their potential causes.

# Resampling Analysis:

Resampled stock data (daily, weekly, monthly) to observe trends at different granularities.
Compared different resampling techniques to see how stock behavior changes at various time intervals.

# Multi-Variate Analysis:

Performed multi-variate analysis on stock data to understand correlations between different stocks and market variables.
Explored the relationship between multiple stock prices and other financial indicators.

# Correlation Analysis:

Calculated and visualized the correlation between various stocks to understand market dependencies.
Used heatmaps and pair plots to study how the stocks influence each other.

# Technologies Used:

Python: The core programming language used for analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib/Subplot/plotly/Pairplot/PairGrid: For data visualization.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Jupyter Notebook: For an interactive development environment.

# Results & Insights:
Identified trends in stock price movements, particularly focusing on Apple.
Derived insights from moving averages and stock correlations, helping in predicting potential market behavior.
Highlighted the usefulness of multi-variate and correlation analysis for making informed investment decisions.
Conclusion:
This project provides an in-depth understanding of stock price analysis using Python and common financial tools. It can be used as a foundation for further analysis or expanded to include more stocks and indicators.
